      The CX Series provides exclusive compute resources for compute
      intensive applications.

      *CX* is the abbreviation of "Compute Exclusive".

      The exclusive resources are given to the compute threads of the
      VM. In order to ensure this, some additional cores (depending
      on the number of disks and NICs) will be requested to offload
      the IO threading from cores dedicated to the workload.
      In addition, in this series, the NUMA topology of the used
      cores is provided to the VM.

      The amount of spec.cpu.maxSockets is set to the same as
      guest cpus. This avoids KubeVirt's default behavior of
      providing extra CPUs for hotplugging, which can exceed the
      amount of available CPUs on a node and cause the VM to fail.

      Requirements for CX series instance types:
      - CPU manager has to be enabled.
      - Huge pages have to be available on the nodes.
