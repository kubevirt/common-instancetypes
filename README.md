# kubevirt/common-instancetypes

A set of [instance types and preferences](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/instancetypes/) to help create [`KubeVirt`](https://kubevirt.io)  [`VirtualMachines`](http://kubevirt.io/api-reference/main/definitions.html#_v1alpha1_virtualmachine).

# Overview

## Structure

The available instance types can be divided into two categories:

1. Workload agnostic - or general purpose
2. Workload specific

Workload agnostic instance types are a good starting point to run your workload.
Once you know more about the requirements of your workload, you can start choosing a
workload specific instance type.

The following diagram summarizes the available instance types and their use-cases:

## U Series

The U Series is quite neutral and provides resources for
general purpose applications.

*U* is the abbreviation for "Universal", hinting at the universal
attitude towards workloads.

VMs of instance types will share physical CPU cores on a
time-slice basis with other VMs.

### U Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Burstable CPU performance* - The workload has a baseline compute
  performance but is permitted to burst beyond this baseline, if
  excess compute resources are available.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:4)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:4, for less
  noise per node.

## O Series

The O Series is based on the U Series, with the only difference
being that memory is overcommitted.

*O* is the abbreviation for "Overcommitted".

### UO Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Burstable CPU performance* - The workload has a baseline compute
  performance but is permitted to burst beyond this baseline, if
  excess compute resources are available.
- *Overcommitted Memory* - Memory is over-committed in order to achieve
  a higher workload density.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:4)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:4, for less
  noise per node.

## CX Series

The CX Series provides exclusive compute resources for compute
intensive applications.

*CX* is the abbreviation of "Compute Exclusive".

The exclusive resources are given to the compute threads of the
VM. In order to ensure this, some additional cores (depending
on the number of disks and NICs) will be requested to offload
the IO threading from cores dedicated to the workload.
In addition, in this series, the NUMA topology of the used
cores is provided to the VM.

### CX Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Hugepages* - Hugepages are used in order to improve memory
  performance.
- *Dedicated CPU* - Physical cores are exclusively assigned to every
  vCPU in order to provide fixed and high compute guarantees to the
  workload.
- *Isolated emulator threads* - Hypervisor emulator threads are isolated
  from the vCPUs in order to reduce emaulation related impact on the
  workload.
- *vNUMA* - Physical NUMA topology is reflected in the guest in order to
  optimize guest sided cache utilization.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:2)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:2.

## GN Series

The GN Series provides instances types intended for VMs with
NVIDIA GPU resources attached.

*GN* is the abbreviation of "GPU NVIDIA".

This series is intended to be used with VMs consuming GPUs
provided by the
[NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator)
which can be installed on Kubernetes and also is made available
on OpenShift via OperatorHub.

### GN Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Has GPUs* - Has GPUs predefined.
- *Burstable CPU performance* - The workload has a baseline compute
  performance but is permitted to burst beyond this baseline, if
  excess compute resources are available.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:4)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:4, for less
  noise per node.

## M Series

The M Series provides resources for memory intensive
applications.

*M* is the abbreviation of "Memory".

### M Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Hugepages* - Hugepages are used in order to improve memory
  performance.
- *Burstable CPU performance* - The workload has a baseline compute
  performance but is permitted to burst beyond this baseline, if
  excess compute resources are available.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:8)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:8, for much
  less noise per node.

## N Series

The N Series provides resources for network intensive DPDK
applications, like VNFs.

*N* is the abbreviation for "Network".

This series of instancetypes requires nodes capable
of running DPDK workloads and being marked with the respective
node-role.kubevirt.io/worker-dpdk label as such.

### N Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Hugepages* - Hugepages are used in order to improve memory
  performance.
- *Dedicated CPU* - Physical cores are exclusively assigned to every
  vCPU in order to provide fixed and high compute guarantees to the
  workload.
- *Isolated emulator threads* - Hypervisor emulator threads are isolated
  from the vCPUs in order to reduce emaulation related impact on the
  workload.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:2)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:2.

## RT Series

The RT Series provides resources for realtime applications, like Oslat.

*RT* is the abbreviation for "realtime".

This series of instance types requires nodes capable of running
realtime applications.

### RT Series Characteristics

Specific characteristics of this series are:
- *Hugepages* - Hugepages are used in order to improve memory
  performance.
- *Dedicated CPU* - Physical cores are exclusively assigned to every
  vCPU in order to provide fixed and high compute guarantees to the
  workload.
- *Isolated emulator threads* - Hypervisor emulator threads are isolated
  from the vCPUs in order to reduce emaulation related impact on the
  workload.
- *vCPU-To-Memory Ratio (1:4)* - A vCPU-to-Memory ratio of 1:4 starting from
  the medium size.
