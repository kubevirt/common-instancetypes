      The CX Series provides exclusive compute resources for compute
      intensive applications.

      *CX* is the abbreviation of "Compute Exclusive".

      The exclusive resources are given to the compute threads of the
      VM. In order to ensure this, some additional cores (depending
      on the number of disks and NICs) will be requested to offload
      the IO threading from cores dedicated to the workload.
      In addition, in this series, the NUMA topology of the used
      cores is provided to the VM.
